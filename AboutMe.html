      About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
      My name is Nikolaj Freschlin, I am a freshman here at the University of Rhode Island.  I am currently studying Psychology while eventually minoring in Computer Science as I am very interested in the creation of Artificial Intelligence and hope to eventually develop my own.  In my free time I enjoy watching and playing sports, my favorites being baseball, basketball and rugby, the latter of which I play here at URI.  I am fascinated with the art of coding as it is a fundemental building block in our society today, and its something I believe everyone should at least be familiar with.
